**Attendance Recording System with Device-Student Verification**

Backend: C# .NET 7 with Entity Framework

Frontend: React 18, Vite, and TypeScript

Features:

1. Lecturer Signup:
   - Lecturers can sign up to manage student attendance.

2. QR Code Generation:
   - Lecturers can generate a QR code that is valid for the class session, typically lasting 2 hours.

3. QR Code Display:
   - The generated QR code is displayed for students to scan.

4. Student Login:
   - Upon scanning the QR code, students are prompted to log in using their student email.

5. Student Information Collection:
   - The system collects the following student details:
     - First name
     - Last name
     - Email address
     - Device identifier

6. Duplicate Check:
   - The system verifies that each device can only record attendance for a unique student. Duplicate entries from the same device for the same student are prevented.

7. Confirmation Prompt:
   - Students are prompted to confirm the accuracy of their collected details.

8. Attendance Collection:
   - The system collects attendance information.

9. Notification:
   - Students receive a notification confirming that their attendance has been recorded.

Additional Requirements:

1. QR Code Validity:
   - The QR code generated by the lecturer is only valid during the class session. A new valid QR code is automatically regenerated based on the original QR code every 30 seconds.

This system ensures that each device can only record attendance for a unique student, preventing duplicate attendance records.
